# To install old versions of R, specific Nix revisions must be used. This tool
# [Nix Package Versions](https://lazamar.co.uk/nix-versions/) provides a simple
# web-interface to look for packages and get their revisions.

# It is possible to scrape the table and get the data, but the code below
# should not be executed and is instead kept for historcial reasons:

# This is commented as it is not needed anymore

# The code above provided commits up until version 4.3.1. The commit for the

# commit that contains all the fixes that were merged during this release. This
# ensures that a maximum of packages are in a working state.
