## Introduction

This vignette describes interactive use of environments built with `{rix}` using
an IDE (GUI editor) like RStudio. Depending on your operating system and the
editor you wish to use, different settings must be configured.

It is also possible to evaluate single functions inside a dedicated, separate,
environment from another, main, interactive R session. For more details
regarding this, refer to the vignette `vignette("z-advanced-topic-running-r-or-shell-code-in-nix-from-r")`.

### Our recommendation

The following are the setups we recommend you use to work using an IDE and Nix
environments. To be recommended, a setup should:

- be easy to setup;
- work the same on any operating system;
- not require any type of special maintenance.

Regardless of your operating system, a general-purpose editor such as VS Code
(or Codium), Emacs, or Neovim meets the above requirements. (Note: Neovim is not
covered here due to lack of experienceâ€”PRs welcome!) However, some editors
perform better on certain platforms.

#### Recommended setup on macOS

On macOS, RStudio will not be able to interact with Nix shells, so you cannot
use it. As such, we recommend either VS Code (or Codium) or Positron. Emacs or
Neovim are also good options. See the relevant sections below to set up any of
these editors. We also recommend to install the editor on macOS directly, and
configure it to interact with Nix shells, instead of using Nix to install the
editor, even though it does take some more effort to configure.

#### Recommended setup on Windows

On Windows, since you have to use Nix through WSL, your options are limited to
editors that either:

- can be installed on Windows and interact with WSL, or
- can be launched directly from WSL.

We recommend to use an editor you can install directly on Windows and configure
to interact nicely with WSL, and it turns out that this is mostly only VS Code
(or Codium). There are ways to configure Positron to interact with WSL, but it
requires significant effort and this is not discussed here. See
[this section](#configuring-native-vs-codecodium-on-your-operating-system)
to learn how to configure VS Code (or Codium).

If you want to use RStudio or Positron, this is also possible but:

- RStudio or Positron should ideally be installed with Nix inside WSL;
- your version of Windows needs to support
  [WSLg](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps) which
  should be fine on Windows 11 or the very latest Windows 10 builds. WSLg allows
  you to run GUI apps from WSL.

However, be aware that there is a bug in WSLg that prevents modifier keys like
[Alt Gr](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/issues/890) from working properly.

If you prefer Emacs or Neovim, then we recommend to install it in WSL and use
it in command line mode, not through WSLg (so starting Emacs with the `- nw`
argument).

#### Recommended setup on Linux

On Linux distributions, the only real limitation is that RStudio cannot interact
with Nix shells (just like on the other operating systems), so if you want to
use RStudio then you need to install it using Nix.

If you use another editor, just follow the relevant instructions below; the
question you need to think about is whether you want to use Nix to install the
editor inside of the development shell or if you prefer to install your editor
yourself using your distribution's package manager, and configure it to interact
with Nix shells. We recommend the latter option, regardless of the editor you
choose.

## RStudio

RStudio **must** be installed by Nix in order to *see* and use Nix shells. So
you cannot use the RStudio already installed on your computer to work with Nix
shells. This means you need to set `ide = "rstudio"` if you wish to use RStudio.

### RStudio on macOS

As of writing, RStudio is not yet available for macOS through Nixpkgs, which
means that you cannot use RStudio to work with Nix shells. [There is a draft PR
that will introduce RStudio for
macOS](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/362637) though. As soon as this PR
is merged, it will become possible to use RStudio on macOS with Nix shells. In
the meantime, you might consider using [Positron](#positron).

### RStudio on Linux or Windows

To use RStudio on Linux or Windows simply use `ide = "rstudio"`. Then, build the
environment using `nix-build` and drop into the shell using `nix-shell`. Then,
type `rstudio` to start RStudio. On Windows, you need to have `WSLg` enabled,
which should be the case on the latest versions of Windows. If you wish, you can
even put the `rstudio` command in the shell hook to start it immediately as you
run `nix-shell`.

On Linux and WSL, depending on your desktop environment, you might see the
following error message when trying to launch RStudio:

```
qt.glx: qglx_findConfig: Failed to finding matching FBConfig for QSurfaceFormat(version 2.0, options QFlags<QSurfaceFormat::FormatOption>(), depthBufferSize -1, redBufferSize 1, greenBufferSize 1, blueBufferSize 1, alphaBufferSize -1, stencilBufferSize -1, samples -1, swapBehavior QSurfaceFormat::SingleBuffer, swapInterval 1, colorSpace QSurfaceFormat::DefaultColorSpace, profile  QSurfaceFormat::NoProfile)
Could not initialize GLX
Aborted (core dumped)
```

in this case, run the following before running RStudio:

```
export QT_XCB_GL_INTEGRATION=none
```

## Positron

### Letting Nix manage Positron

If you want to install Positron with Nix, you need a call that looks like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rix(
  date = ...,
  r_pkgs = c(...), # whatever packages you need
  ide = "positron",
  ...
)
```

The advantage of letting Nix handle Positron is that you don't need to configure
anything else. Simply build your environment using `nix-build`, then activate
the shell using `nix-shell` and run `positron` to start using Positron in the
right environment (you can even put the `positron` command in the shell hook to
start it immediately as you run `nix-shell`). Settings and extensions are shared
between all the different Positrons of all your different shells so you don't
need to waste time reconfiguring different instances of Positron, and Nix shells
that use the same version of Positron will not install it twice, but simply
reuse it. However, if the version is slightly different, then a new version will
be installed.

To avoid having different versions of Positron installed on your system, you can
instead opt for the option where you install a single Positron instance on your
system and use it with all the Nix shells.

### Configuring Positron installed on macOS to interact with Nix shells

If you prefer to use the Positron you have installed system-wide, then
generate environments by setting `ide = "none"`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rix(
  date = ...,
  r_pkgs = c(...),
  ide = "none",
  ...
)
```

Start by installing Positron using the official `.dmg` installer. Start
Positron, and then the command palette using `COMMAND-SHIFT-P`. In the search
bar, type `"Install 'positron' command in PATH"` and click on it: this will make
it possible to start Positron from a terminal. Quit Positron completely. To use
it with a Nix shell, open a terminal and navigate to the project's folder, then
activate the shell using `nix-shell` and now start Positron by typing
`positron`. In the top right corner of Positron, you will now be able to select
the R interpreter defined in the Nix shell.

### Configuring Positron installed on Linux or Windows to interact with Nix shells

On Linux, simply install Positron using the installer (the `.deb` or `.rpm`
package depending on your distribution) and on Windows **DO NOT INSTALL**
Positron using the Windows installer! You need to install Positron in your WSL
distribution. Assuming your distribution is Ubuntu, download `.deb` package
and put it in a folder in your WSL distribution, or run the following
from line from Ubuntu (change Positron's version to whatever is current):

```
wget https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/releases/download/2025.02.0-137/Positron-2025.02.0-137-x64.deb
```

then run:

```
sudo dpkg -i Positron-2025.02.0-137-x64.deb
```

This will install Positron in WSL.

Then, navigate to your project's folder and start the Nix shell using
`nix-shell` and then Positron by typing `positron`. On Linux, this will start
your system-level Positron, on Windows, this will start the WSL Positron using
WSLg. That WSL Positron is available for any Nix shells from WSL.

## VS Code/Codium

You can use VS Code or Codium (henceforth, I'll refer to both these editors
simply as "Code") with Nix shells by either installing it through Nix (so by
setting `ide = "code"` or `ide = "codium"`) or by installing it on your
operating system and then configure it to be able to interact with Nix shells.
In any case, you will need to install the `{languageserver}` R package for Code
to interact properly with the R console.

Settings and extensions are shared between all the different Codes of all your
different shells so you don't need to waste time reconfiguring different
instances of Code, and Nix shells that use the same version of Code will not
install it twice, but simply reuse it. However, if the version is slightly
different, then a new version will be installed.

To avoid having different versions of Code installed on your system, you can
instead opt for the option where you install Code for your system using the
usual installation method (so an installer for Windows or macOS, through your
operating system's package manager for any Linux distribution), and instead
configure it to interact with Nix shells.

If you're on Windows, using Code like this is particularly interesting, because
it allows you to install Code on Windows as usual, and then you can configure
it to interact with a Nix shell, even if it's running from WSL. This is a very
seamless experience.

### Letting Nix manage VS Code/Codium

So, concretely, if you want to install Code with Nix, you need a call that looks
like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rix(
  date = ...,
  r_pkgs = c("languageserver", ...), # languageserver is needed
  ide = "code", # or "codium"
  ...
)
```

Or if you prefer to use the Code you have installed system-wide, then:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rix(
  date = ...,
  r_pkgs = c("languageserver", ...), # languageserver is needed
  ide = "none",
  ...
)
```

The advantage of letting Nix handle Code is that you don't need to configure
anything else. Simply build your environment using `nix-build`, then activate
the shell using `nix-shell` and run `code` (for VS Code) or `codium` (for
Codium). You can even put the `code` (or `codium`) command in the shell hook
argument to have it start as soon as you drop in the development shell using
`nix-shell`.

### Configuring native VS Code/Codium on your operating system

The same instructions apply whether your host operating system is Linux, macOS
or Windows. The first step is of course to install Code on your operating system
using the usual means of installing software.

If you're on Windows, install Code on Windows, not in WSL. Code on Windows is
able to interact with WSL seamlessly and before continuing here, please follow
[these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode).

Then, you need to install a piece of software called `direnv`: `direnv` will
automatically load Nix shells when you open a project that contains a
`default.nix` file in an editor. It works on any operating system and many
editors support it, including Code. Follow the instructions for your operating
system [here](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) but if you're using
Windows, install `direnv` in WSL, so follow the instructions for whatever Linux
distribution you're using there (likely Ubuntu), or use Nix to install `direnv`
if you prefer (this is the way I recommend to install it on macOS, unless you
already use `brew`):

```
nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -iA direnv
```

This will install `direnv` and make it available even outside of Nix shells!

Then, in Code, install the
[direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv-vscode) extension (and also the
WSL extension if you're on Windows, as explained in the official documentation
linked above!). Finally, add a file called `.envrc` and simply write `use nix`
in it. Now, open the project's folder using `File > Open Folder...` and you will
see a pop-up stating `direnv: /PATH/TO/PROJECT/.envrc is blocked` and a button
to allow it. Click `Allow` and then open an R script. You might get another
pop-up asking you to restart the extension, so click `Restart`. Be aware that at
this point, `direnv` will run `nix-shell` and so will start building the
environment. If that particular environment hasn't been built and cached yet, it
might take some time before Code will be able to interact with it. You might get
yet another popup, this time from the R Code extension complaining that R can't
be found. In this case, simply restart Code and open the project folder again:
now it should work every time. For a new project, simply repeat this process:

- Generate the project's `default.nix` file;
- Build it using `nix-build`;
- Create an `.envrc` and write `use nix` in it;
- Open the project's folder in Code and click allow when prompted;
- Restart the extension and Code if necessary.

Another option is to create the `.envrc` file and write `use nix` in it, then
open a terminal, navigate to the project's folder, and run `direnv allow`. Doing
this before open Code should not prompt you anymore.

## Emacs

### Letting Nix manage Emacs

Emacs can be installed through Nix, but is not an option of the `ide` argument.
This is because there are several versions of Emacs available through Nix (find
these versions
[here](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=emacs))
so install whatever version you want by putting it in `system_pkgs` like so:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rix(
  date = ...,
  r_pkgs = c(...), # whatever packages you need
  system_pkgs = "emacs",
  ...
)
```

This doesn't require any further configuration to use. Simply drop in the Nix
shell using `nix-shell` and type `emacs`. You can set the `emacs` command as the
shell hook so Emacs starts automatically upon entering the shell. On Windows, if
WSLg is enabled, it'll start Emacs from WSL, if not, it'll start it as a
terminal application. we recommend using Emacs as a terminal application instead
of through WSLg, as there is a bug in WSLg that prevents modifier keys like
[AltGr](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/issues/890) from working properly. This is
quite problematic with Emacs, so we recommend using it in cli mode using `emacs
-nw`.

### Configuring native Emacs on your operating system

You can install Emacs on Linux and macOS and configure it to interact with Nix
shells. Install Emacs using the usual means of installing software on your
operating system. On Windows you cannot use the native Emacs installed on Windows
to interact with WSL, so you will need to install Emacs on WSL. If your WSL
distribution is Ubuntu (which it likely is), you can install Emacs with:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y emacs
```

Because youâ€™re using the Emacs from your operating system, generate `default.nix`
shells by setting `ide = "other"`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rix(
  date = ...,
  r_pkgs = c(...), # whatever packages you need
  ide = "other",
  ...
)
```

Then, you need to install a piece of software called `direnv`: `direnv` will
automatically load Nix shells when you open a project that contains a
`default.nix` file in an editor. It works on any operating system and many
editors support it, including Emacs. Follow the instructions for your operating
system [here](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) but if you're using
Windows, install `direnv` in WSL, so follow the instructions for whatever Linux
distribution you're using there (likely Ubuntu), or use Nix to install `direnv`
if you prefer (this is the way I recommend to install it on macOS, unless you
already use `brew`):

```
nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -iA direnv
```

This will install `direnv` and make it available even outside of Nix shells!

Then install the Emacs `direnv`
[package](https://github.com/wbolster/emacs-direnv). Finally, add a file called
`.envrc` and simply write `use nix` in it. Now, open the project's folder in a
terminal and type `direnv allow`. Be aware that at this point, `direnv` will run
`nix-shell` and so will start building the environment. If that particular
environment hasn't been built and cached yet, it might take some time. Starting
Emacs and loading a script from that folder will now load the environment for
you automatically. On Windows, starting Emacs from WSL will start the Linux GUI
version using WSLg. As mentioned in the introduction, be aware that there is a
bug in WSLg that prevents modifier keys like [Alt
Gr](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/issues/890) from working properly. This is
quite problematic with Emacs, so we recommend using it in cli mode using `emacs
-nw`.

For a new project, simply repeat this process:

- Generate the project's `default.nix` file;
- Build it using `nix-build`;
- Create an `.envrc` and write `use nix` in it;
- Open the project's folder in a terminal and run `direnv allow`.

## Making a launcher to start your editor

If you don't use `direnv` to automatically load the Nix shell with your editor,
you can also create a launcher using `rix::make_launcher("rstudio")` (change
`"rstudio"` to whichever command starts your editor). This will create a script
called `start-EDITOR.sh` where `EDITOR` will be replaced by what you used before.

The contents of the script are the following:

```
#!/usr/bin/env nix-shell
#!nix-shell default.nix -i bash
EDITOR
```

Give this script execution rights (by using `chmod +x start-EDITOR.sh` in a
terminal) and youâ€™ll be able to start your editor in the right environment by
either clicking on it, or by running `./start-EDITOR.sh` in the terminal.

(On Linux, if you use RStudio, and only if needed, add the `export
QT_XCB_GL_INTEGRATION=none` line before `rstudio`).

You can also define a shortcut to a project that will take care of activating
the environment and launching your editor. This way, you don't need to start a
terminal in that folder and drop into the Nix environment each time you want to
work on this project. For example, you could define a bash alias like this:

```
alias kmeans='nix-shell ~/Documents/kmeans/default.nix --run rstudio
```

which would then execute RStudio in the right project by simply typing `kmeans`
in a terminal for your project that uses the K-means algorithm.
